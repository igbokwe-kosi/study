# Mini-VLAT Introduction

You are about to begin a short visualization literacy assessment.

Each question is timed. A timer will appear when you have 10 left, and after you will be unable to answer the question and we have to advance to the next question. Please work quickly and choose the best answer based on the visualization.

If you need a brief moment to prepare, you can do so now and then continue when ready.
