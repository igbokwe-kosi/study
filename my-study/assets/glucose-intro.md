# Glucose Data Visualization Assessment

Thank you for completing the first two sections of this study. In this final section, you will review your glucose tracking data presented as visualizations.

You will see your glucose readings displayed across four different time periods:

- **7-Day View:** Your most recent week of glucose monitoring
- **14-Day View:** A two-week summary of your readings
- **30-Day View:** A monthly overview of your glucose patterns
- **90-Day View:** A quarterly perspective of your glucose trends

For each visualization, you will see two reference lines:

- **Red dashed line at 70 mg/dL:** Represents the lower threshold for optimal glucose levels
- **Orange dashed line at 180 mg/dL:** Represents the upper threshold for optimal glucose levels

After reviewing each visualization, you will be asked 11 brief questions about how clear and useful you found the display. Your feedback will help us improve how glucose data is presented to patients during clinical consultations.

Please take your time reviewing each chart and provide your honest assessment. This section should take approximately 10-15 minutes.
