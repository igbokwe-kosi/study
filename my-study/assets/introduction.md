# About This Study

## Welcome

Thank you for your interest in participating in this research study conducted at the University of Calgary.

## Study Purpose

This study investigates how visualization literacy relates to the interpretation and understanding of data visualizations. We are interested in learning how well people can read and understand different types of visual information presentations.

## What This Study Involves

Your participation will include three parts:

### Part 1: Demographic Questionnaire
We'll ask you about:
- Basic demographic characteristics
- Your educational background
- Your experience with data and visualizations

### Part 2: Mini-VLAT (Visualization Literacy Assessment Test)
You'll complete a series of questions that ask you to interpret and understand various data visualizations. This assessment helps us measure visualization literacy—how well you can read and comprehend visual information. This is not a test of your "correctness" but rather helps us understand how people naturally interpret visual information.

### Part 3: Aggregation Survey
You'll be asked about your preferences and understanding regarding how data should be aggregated and displayed.
