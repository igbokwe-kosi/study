This consent form, a copy of which has been given to you, is only part of the process of informed consent. If you want more details about something mentioned here or information not included here, you should feel free to ask. Please take the time to read this carefully and to understand any accompanying information.

The University of Calgary Conjoint Faculties Research Ethics Board has approved this study (REB25-2072).

Participation is completely voluntary, and data shared during this study will be kept confidential.

## Purpose of the Study

The purpose of this study is to examine how patients with diabetes and clinicians understand and respond to different charts depicting blood glucose patterns. We want to find out which types of charts are easiest to read and most helpful for understanding trends in glucose data.

## What Will I Be Asked to Do?

You will be asked to:

1. Provide your name and email for communication.
2. Complete a short demographic questionnaire (age range, gender, education level, etc.).
3. View several sample glucose charts on a website.
4. Answer a short online survey (about 20–30 minutes) about how easy the charts were to understand.

Your responses will be stored without your name or email attached.

## What Type of Personal Information Will Be Collected?

If you agree to participate, you will be asked to provide:

- Your name and email address (for communication and to match your participation to your responses).
- Basic demographic information such as:
  - Age group (for example, 18–25, 26–35, etc.)
  - Gender
  - Highest level of education
  - Diabetic diagnosis and how you track your data

No social insurance numbers, ID numbers, or medical record numbers will be collected.

Your name and email will be stored separately from your survey or interview responses and will only be used to contact you about the study and to keep track of who has completed it. Your study data will be analyzed without your name or email attached.

This study does not require audio or video recordings. Your responses to the questionnaire will be stored in a password-protected university-hosted data storage space.

## Privacy and Anonymity Options

There are several options for you to consider if you decide to take part in this research. You can choose all, some, or none of them. You will be asked to indicate your preferences during the consent step.

You are free to decline to answer any of the survey questions.

## Are there Risks or Benefits if I Participate?

This is a minimal risk study. The main inconvenience is the time it takes to complete the study (about 20–30 minutes). You may experience mild screen fatigue or brief frustration if a chart is difficult to interpret. You may skip any questions you do not wish to answer, and you may stop at any time. No sensitive or personal questions about trauma, mental health, or illegal activities will be asked.

There are no direct personal benefits to you. You may find it interesting to see different ways of displaying glucose data. The results of the study may help improve how blood glucose information is presented to patients and clinicians and may support clearer communication about long-term glucose trends.

After we confirm the validity of your responses, you may receive an $8 CAD Gift Card. If you do not complete the study, no payment will be issued. There are no costs to you for taking part.

## What Happens to the Information I Provide?

You are free to withdraw from this study at any point during the study and up to 3 days after the day of your study. If this occurs, we will discard all data related to your participation.

All data received from this study will be kept for 5 years in a secure location. Only the investigators indicated on this form will have access to this raw data.

In any written reports created based on this study, you will be represented anonymously (unless you have requested differently) using a pseudonym or participant number (e.g. Participant 4). No personal or confidential information will be published.

## Signatures

Your signature on this form indicates that 1) you understand to your satisfaction the information provided to you about your participation in this research project, and 2) you agree to participate in the research project.

In no way does this waive your legal rights nor release the investigators, sponsors, or involved institutions from their legal and professional responsibilities.
